# PassKey
A simple console password Generator written in C++ for Windows and Linux.

The program is given with an executable version for Windows (PassKey.exe), but the C++ code is compilable on both Linux and Windows.
It uses the standard library for Linux and Windows-specific libraries for Windows version.

***On Windows:***

  The program displays a starting text, press "**ENTER**" to use it.
  Then, the program is generating code until you press "**BACKSPACE**" key.
  You can select, copy then paste the given password wherever you want ! **:)**
  
***On Linux:***

  The program displays a starting text, and instantly a new generated password.
  You can select, copy then paste it wherever you want !
  
***What's the aim of the program ?***

  PassKey's goal is to create complex passwords from time when you don't have the inspiration to do so yourself.

***Is there a future to this program ?***

  Of course !
  This is only a part of a future (probable) project that will come out with GUI, passwords manager etc.
  However, this can help to build your project with randomly-generated strings (**character arrays.**)
